CBC	Complete Blood Count	A complete blood count is a blood test used to evaluate your overall health and detect a wide range of disorders, including anemia, infection and leukemia. The test measures several components and features of your blood, including red blood cells.	
WBC	White Blood Cells	White blood cells help to fight infections. If you have high WBC levels, your doctor can deduce that you may have inflammation or infection somewhere in your body. If your levels are low, you still may be at risk for infection.	4.5 - 10.0 10^3/uL (A microliter is a very tiny amount–one millionth of a liter)
RBC	Red Blood Cell Count	This is the number of red blood cells you have. These are important because they deliver oxygen through your body. They also help carry carbon dioxide. If your RBC count is too low, you may have anemia or another condition. (If you have anemia, your blood has fewer red blood cells than normal.)	Male: 4.5 - 5.9 10^6/uL; Female: 4.1 - 5.1 10^6/uL (A microliter is a very tiny amount–one millionth of a liter)
HGB	Hemoglobin	This is the protein in your blood that holds the oxygen.	Male: 14 - 17.5 g/dL; Female: 12.3 - 15.3 g/dL
HCT	Hematocrit	This value provides information about how much of your blood is comprised of red blood cells. A low score on the range scale may be a sign that you have too little iron, the mineral that helps produce red blood cells. A high score could mean you’re dehydrated or have another condition.	Male: 41.5 - 50.4%; Female: 36.9 - 44.6%
MCV	Mean Corpuscular Volume	This is the average size of your red blood cells. If they’re bigger than normal, your MCV goes up. That could happen if you have low vitamin B12 or folate levels. If your red blood cells are smaller, you could have a type of anemia. A normal-range MCV score is 80 to 96.	80 - 96 pg
MCH	Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin	mean corpuscular hemoglobin. MCH levels refer to the average amount of hemoglobin found in the red blood cells in the body. Hemoglobin is a protein in the blood that allows red blood cells to deliver oxygen to the cells and tissues in the body.	27 - 33 pg
MCHC	Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration	Simply put, this is the measurement of how much hemoglobin is inside one red blood cell. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that helps transport oxygen within the blood.	31 - 37 g/dL
PLT	Platelet Count	A platelet count that's lower than normal (thrombocytopenia) or higher than normal (thrombocytosis) is often a sign of an underlying medical condition, or it may be a side effect from medication. If your platelet count is outside the normal range, you'll likely need additional tests to diagnose the cause. It’s dangerous to be below 10,000 platelets per microliter	150 - 450 10^3/uL
RDW-SD	Red Blood Cell Distribution Width	The RDW-SD is an actual measurement of the width of the red cell distribution curve in femtoliters (fL). The width of the distribution curve is measured at the point that is 20% above the baseline. Since the RDW-SD is an actual measurement, it is not influenced by the MCV and more accurately reflects the red cell size variance.	40 - 55 fL
RDW-CV	Red Blood Cell Distribution Width	The RDW-CV is a calculation based on both the width of the distribution curve and the mean cell size. It is calculated by dividing the standard deviation of the mean cell size by the MCV of the red cells and multiplying by 100 to convert to a percentage. Because it is a calculation, the RDW-CV is dependent not only on the width of the distribution curve but also the MCV of the red cell population and may not always reflect the actual variation in red cell size. 	11 - 15%
MPV	Mean Platelet Volume	An MPV test measures the average size of your platelets. It's closely related to a platelet count test, which measures the number of platelets in your blood. A typical range of platelet volumes is 9.4–12.3 fL (femtolitre), equivalent to spheres 2.65 to 2.9 µm in diameter.

CMP	Comprehensive Metabolic Panel	The comprehensive metabolic panel is a frequently ordered panel of 14 tests that gives a healthcare provider important information about the current status of a person's metabolism, including the health of the kidneys and liver, electrolyte and acid/base balance as well as levels of blood glucose and blood proteins. Abnormal results, and especially combinations of abnormal results, can indicate a problem that needs to be addressed.
