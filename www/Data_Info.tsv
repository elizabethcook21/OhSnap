CBC	Complete Blood Count		A complete blood count is a blood test used to evaluate your overall health and detect a wide range of disorders, including anemia, infection and leukemia. The test measures several components and features of your blood, including red blood cells.		https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/complete-blood-count#1				
WBC	White Blood Cells	10^3/uL	White blood cells help fight infections. If you have high WBC levels, your doctor can deduce that you may have inflammation or infection somewhere in your body. If your levels are low, you still may be at risk for infection.	4.0 - 10.0 10^3/uL (A microliter is a very tiny amount–one millionth of a liter)	https://www.healthline.com/health/wbc-count#types-of-wbcs	4	10		
RBC	Red Blood Cell Count	10^6/uL	Red blood cells deliver oxygen and carbon dioxide throughout your body. They contain hemoglobin and are normally uniform in size and shape. If your RBC count is too low, you may have anemia or another condition (if you have anemia, your blood has fewer red blood cells than normal).	Male: 4.5 - 5.9 10^6/uL; Female: 4.1 - 5.1 10^6/uL (A microliter is a very tiny amount–one millionth of a liter)	https://www.healthline.com/health/rbc-count	4.5	5.9	4.1	5.1
HGB	Hemoglobin	g/dL	Hemoglobin is a protein in the blood that allows red blood cells to deliver oxygen to the cells and tissues in the body.	Male: 14 - 17.5 g/dL; Female: 12.3 - 15.3 g/dL	https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/low-hemoglobin/basics/definition/sym-20050760	14	17.5	12.3	15.3
HCT	Hematocrit	%	Hematocrit provides information about how much of your blood is comprised of red blood cells. A low score on the range scale may be a sign that you have too little iron, the mineral that helps produce red blood cells. A high score could mean that you’re dehydrated or have another condition.	Male: 41.5 - 50.4%; Female: 36.9 - 44.6%	https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/hematocrit/about/pac-20384728	41.5	50.4	36.9	44.6
MCV	Mean Corpuscular Volume	pg	Mean corpuscular volume is the average size of your red blood cells. If they’re bigger than normal, your MCV increases. This may happen if you have low vitamin B12 or folate levels. If your red blood cells are smaller, you may have a type of anemia.	80 - 96 pg		80	96		
MCH	Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin	pg	Mean corpuscular hemoglobin levels refer to the average amount of hemoglobin found in the red blood cells in the body. Hemoglobin is a protein in the blood that allows red blood cells to deliver oxygen to the cells and tissues in the body.	27 - 33 pg		27	33		
MCHC	Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration	g/dL	Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration is the average amount of hemoglobin inside a single red blood cell. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that helps transport oxygen within the blood.	31 - 37 g/dL		31	37		
PLT	Platelet Count	10^3/uL	Platelets are cells that circulate within your blood and bind together when they recognize damaged blood vessel. A platelet count that is lower than normal (thrombocytopenia) or higher than normal (thrombocytosis) is often a sign of an underlying medical condition, or it may be a side effect from medication. If your platelet count is outside the normal range, you'll likely need additional tests to diagnose the cause. It’s dangerous to be below 10,000 platelets per microliter.	150 - 450 10^3/uL		150	450		
RDW-SD	Red Blood Cell Distribution Width - Standard Deviation	fL	The standard deviation of the red blood cell distribution width is the measurement of the width of the red cell distribution curve.	40 - 55 fL		40	55		
RDW-CV	Red Blood Cell Distribution Width - Coefficient of Variation	%	The coefficient of variation of the red blood cell distribution width is a statistical calculation based on both the width of the distribution curve and the mean cell size. It is calculated by dividing the standard deviation of the mean cell size by the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of the red blood cells and multiplying by 100 to convert to a percentage. Because it is a calculation, the RDW-CV is dependent not only on the width of the distribution curve but also the MCV of the red cell population and may not always reflect the actual variation in red cell size. 	11 - 15%		11	15		
MPV	Mean Platelet Volume	fL	The mean platelet volume measures the average size of your platelets. Platelets are cells that circulate within your blood and bind together when they recognize damaged blood vessel. MPV closely related to a platelet count test, which measures the number of platelets in your blood.						
NEUT	Neutrophils	%	Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell that helps heal damaged tissues and resolve inflections. These cells are important because, unlike some of the other white blood cells, they aren’t limited to a specific area of circulation. They can move freely through the walls of veins and into the tissues of your body to immediately attack all antigens.	40 - 60%		40	60		
LYMPH	Lymphocytes	%	Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cells that help fight off disease.	20 - 40%		20	40		
MONO	Monocytes	%	Monocytes are another type of white blood cell that ingest bacteria and other foreign objects	2 - 8%		2	8		
EO	Esinophils	%	Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that function in allergic responses and resisting some infections 	1 - 4%		1	4		
BASO	Basophils	%	Basophils are a type of white blood cell that constitute less than 1% of the total white blood count.	0.5 - 1%		0.5	1		
CMP	Comprehensive Metabolic Panel		The comprehensive metabolic panel is a frequently ordered panel of 14 tests that gives a healthcare provider important information about the current status of a person's metabolism, including the health of the kidneys and liver, electrolyte and acid/base balance as well as levels of blood glucose and blood proteins. Abnormal results, and especially combinations of abnormal results, can indicate a problem that needs to be addressed.
